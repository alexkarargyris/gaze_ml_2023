| <a name="Rolff"></a><a href="https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/inst/ab/cv/people/rolff.html"><b>Tim Rolff</b></a> is a 4th year PhD candidate in the Computer Vision and Human-Computer Interaction group at the University of Hamburg, Germany. In his research, he focuses on the prediction of human gaze and gaze events in virtual reality, investigating algorithms for gaze prediction and eye movement analysis. A major emphasis of his work lies on time-to-event prediction of egocentric gaze events using machine learning and deep learning, predicting the “when” and “where” we look in VR. In his spare time, he enjoys working on improving neural radiance fields for VR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
